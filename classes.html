		<p class="credits">3 Credits</p>
		<p class="specialization"></p>
		<p class="description">While archivists, librarians, and museum staff are well aware of the treasures held within their institutions, key user groups who would benefit from knowledge and use of such materials, both virtual and physical, are often not. Additionally, existing patrons of such institutions may not be aware of new acquisitions and novel applications and contextualization of existing materials. Educating constituencies on collections special interest to them benefits both the institution in question and a potentially broadening range of patrons. This course focuses on three aspects of making archival, library, and museum resources known to various user groups: public programs, outreach, and exhibitions. Public programs entail the presentation of one’s materials to a variety of publics. Outreach focuses on the identification of services to constituencies with needs relevant to the institution’s mission, with special attention to underserved groups, and tailoring services to meet those needs. The exhibit, an organized display of materials centered on a theme, fits into a public programming agenda and can function as an effective form of outreach to underserved user groups when thoughtfully and strategically conceived. Here, we will examine information seeking behavior in archival, library, and museum settings, and the principles, design, and implementation of access and outreach services in such institutions. We will explore various types of public programs, outreach strategies, and digital and physical exhibits, study the principles and practical elements involved in creating each, conduct site visits toward understanding the application of such principles in existing institutions, and apply learning in programming, outreach, and exhibit projects.</p>

		<p class="description">Digital Collections in Libraries, Archives and Museums" introduces the practices, standards, and challenges evident across the spectrum of cultural heritage institutions trying to leverage collections online. The course considers the entire life-cycle of digital collections from creation to dissemination to preservation, as well as looking at institutional conditions - past, present and future - that influence collection access online. The current era challenges libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) to connect with their audiences, as well as with their peers, in ways that redefine traditional notions of authority and autonomy. Taking an institutional as well as a network-level perspective, the course tracks this (r)evolution-in-progress and looks at emerging strategies to make digital heritage collections matter in an environment dominated by for-profit networking and information spaces. Concepts introduced in course lectures and discussions will be deepened through focused site visits with experts at local institutions. </p>
